# Draft my schedule clone
A draft-my-schedule clone made for Western's 3316 Web development course using the MEAN stack.
Functionality includes:
 - User accounts
 - Authenticated login
 - Hashed passwords in database
 - Review courses
 - Admin functiinality (Hide reviews, delete timetables)
 - Add/remove courses to timetable
 - Make timetable public
 - Manage multiple timetables

##Disclaimer:
Unfortunately, this project is outdated and would be an expense to host, so I'm just letting the monorepo source sit here for learning purposes. All the code should be here, but you won't be able to establish a mongo connection since the database is not hosted.
